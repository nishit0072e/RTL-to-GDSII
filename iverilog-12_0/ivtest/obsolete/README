Important Notice - this is not the sign-off regression
list for IVL - that is a separate list that Steve Williams
currently has. It is a subset of these tests.

21 April 2007

I've added to CVS regression_report-devel.txt that is the
expected regression test results for the snapshot at the
time of the checkin. I expect to tag this file with the
makes of snapshots that are made, so that the expected
result for a given snapshot can be found.

11/3/2000

Added format.v, and gold/format.gold and test4.v


10/6/2000

Fixed bug in function3.11D.v - now runs on verilog XL okay.
Added #1 before big if clause in drive_strength.v

8/13/2000

Went thru older test submissions and found some missing. Added
stask_parm1.v, assign_mem1, task_inpad, task_omemw2

6/12/2000

Re-release with defparam race condition fixed and mail
headers removed on param_string.

6/11/2000

Added several tests (most sent from Steve Williams as bug
reports.) Added CRASH detection for CE class tests.
Also added Tom Coonan's pic processor to the suite.
Reworked the sregress.pl script to allow addition of
diff/gold AND module choices.

5/08/2000

Modified the script to support log file comparison against gold files and
against created files against gold files. Added Steven Tell's new
fdisplay, and fopen tests.  Added div16.v to the contrib list now that
we can handle $random (this from Tom Coonan)

5/04/2000

Wrote some simple preprocessor tests - didn't find anything -didn't
think I would.. ;-) ifdef1-ifdef4, else1-else3, include1-include3, and
define1. Also now using iverilog.


4/30/2000

Received 4 tests from Peter Monta via Steve Williams.  I'm including
three of them (reworked two to be self-checking..) The new tests are
assign_nb1, wireland, and param_concat and function_exp.

Also added an aliasing mechanism so that we can recover with tests
that barf.  Now you simply type ./regress and it'll run ./sregress.pl.
The difference is that this script sets the coredumpsize to zero via
csh.  This seems to help ALOT.  No arguments are passed - if you want
to use sregress.pl directly - run it under csh with this set!!

4/29/2000

Received scope1 from Steve Williams.

4/28/2000

Added three tests from Steve Williams and commented out wiresr/wiresl
since they're crashing the test bench right now at run time.
Note - We've got some contributed code to compare .vcd results. The
problem is it's in C and everything in this suite todate has been
source files or a perl program -still cogitating how to handle it.

4/27/2000

Several new tests - a couple by myself and a bunch by Steve Williams.
I added a test for Procedural continuous assignment (pca1) and used
this to create another test for Wildcard sensitivity ( always @ *)
from the verilog 2000 spec.

4/16/2000

Added nblkorder to validate case where same variable is assigned
sequentially in a non-blocking always block. This was suggested from
a question on a the comp.lang.verilog usenet group. IVL does the
right thing according to IEEE1364-Draft, page 5-3, section 5.4.1.

This test still needs to be refereed by JML though.

4/10/2000

Added posedge.v and event_list.v sent by S Williams.

4/5/2000

Incorporated 3 tests sent by Steve Williams (dff1, idiv, con_tri) and
wrote fork3.19A, and fork3.19B.

3/13/2000

Well - been a month - geewhiz.  defparam needs main added in
regress.list and had to change the summary error print message
to REPORT file in sregress.pl

2/13/2000

Added readmemb and readmemh tests.

2/11/20000

Been awhile!  Anyway, got a bug report from George Gallant concerning
functions with either case or if statements.  Thus sdw_function4 and
sdw_function5 both which fail. Also need to add readmemh and readmemb!

1/23/2000

Added drive_strength.v and pullupdown.v to test suite. Contributed!

01/13/2000

Wrote mult1.v to test reg and wire multiply case, and modulus.v
to test % operator.  Fixed the race in them. Fixed contrib8.5
in regress.list - it needed to NOT call the top level mod.
Added xnor_test.v sent to me from Steve Williams(via Guy
Hutchinson)

01/10/2000

Added inout.v and modparam.v tests.  inout does some sneaky
stuff with modname(a,a); inout a; This is legal to short
two signals together.  modparam passes paramters down from
a top level module and overides the loever level. Added udp_bufg
back to list. It doesn't work, but doesn't core dump or hang
anymore.

01/02/2000

Fixed the error message from fifo.v to get correctly detected.
(It should say "Failed.") Added gencrc and onehot to the regress.list.

01/01/2000

Added a set of unary operator tests.  unary_and, unary_nand,
unary_or,unary_nor, unary_xor, unary_xnor1, and  unary_xnor2.
There are three elaboration problems in this last bunch. Added
a scan for "Unable" which seems to qualify elaboration
errors to the sregress.pl script.

12/27/99

This is a BIG release for one simple fact. The entire suite has
been tested against Cadence Verilog XL....and we found a bug in
XL!  See time2.v for the failing testcase.

Did some basic maintenance/QA on test suite.  Changed sregress.pl
to use the -l option for XL, as oppossed to redirection.  Works
more reliably on Sun(well - this FIXED a problem with all the
verilog runs going into backround with the >& syntax?)

Fixed always3.1.9A.v, Fixed always3.1.9B.v. Added tests always3.1.9C,D.v
Fixed wiremod1.v, syntax error in ptest006-008 in $display. Howcome
IVL likes these?  Removed sdw_template.v.   Added "PASSED" printout
to z1,z2. This should make them compatible with XL.
Fixed assign3.2D.v syntax error, moved syntax error into assign3.2E.v
to test for it!
Fixed contrib8.4.v so that it prints PASSED.

12/11/99

Added contrib directory and fifo.v in same donated by Tom Coonan.
He's GPL this and other work for inclusion within the test suite!
THANKS TOM!!!!!

Note that two tests always3.1.11B and udp_bufg are commented
out because they hang the testsuite currently.

12/1/99

Added qmark6.v contributed by Dan Nelsen. Muxtest.v validates
X on sel, when inputs are both 1 or 0.

11/12/99

Added several ga_* tests that use a primitive gate vector. The ga_nand.v test
of this sequence fails.  Went thru the ptestxxx.v series and replaced all
!= or == constructs with !==/===.

11/8/99

Fixed stuff added on 11/6 - it now says PASSED!
Added wirele.v, wirege.v, wireeq.v tests.  These with the
CVS 11/7/99 cut that I used to test.

11/6/99

Added tests wireadd1.v  wiremod1.v  wiresl.v  wiresr.v  wiresub1.v  wirexor1.v
Several of the tests in regress.list had the .v extension so they
weren't running correctly. That's fixed.

10/14/99

This is mainly a debug release.  See below.

lh_varindx added (tests left hand variable index of a vector.)
Rewrote always3.1.6A-C COMPLETELY.  Changed time1.v to use
always block and #5 d = a; Added time3.v that looks at same
structure for non-blocking (#5 d <= a).

Added an always3.1.6D.v ( a case test from Steve Williams.)

There was a race condition in the always3.1.6A-C that was
due in part to the nature of always case (x) ...default #1; whoops!

Removed qmark2.v - it became redundant(besides it was broken sematically)

10/5/99

Changed location of #0 to first item in the initial
block for always3.1.6A-C.v This also counts as a
test for proper operation of the semantics for #0
which is used to defeat what would otherwise be
a race condition.  Researched the operation of #0 in
Moorby 4th edition. This seems to be kosher (though
not GOOD programming practice.)

Added several contributed tests by many folks.

Note that the regression_report.txt is the results of
running with the 9/28 IVL release.

9/27/99

Added a #0 to take care of a race in always3.1.6A-C.
Added the ability to put an optional main module name as
a 4th arguement within the regress.list line.

9/20/99

This release collects the tests together along with a
regression script(sregress.pl) which is a modified
version of a script contributed by Guy Hutchison.
(Thanks Guy!!!)

To run the testsuite - ensure that you have the
appropriate IVL environment variables set - the
script doesn't check for THAT yet - maybe next
time;-) You need the appropriate stuff in your
search path for IVL and set VPI_MODULE_PATH and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH as necessary.  See the IVL docs
for info.

Now - simply move into the testsuite directory
and type: ./sregress.pl <cr>

This will run the regression script, and create a
series of log files in the log directory.  The test
runs are summarized in regression_report.txt. The
tests run are obtained from regress.list.

9/9/99

Completed thru 3.14F(tasks).  So Added from Section
3.11-3.14. Updated ivl_test.html file. Also have included
some of the "contributed" tests. Haven't worked them all
into the test document yet.

9/6/99

Completed all of the always block tests.  Added tests
for sections 3.2-3.10.  Reworked the 3.1.5 tests that
had bugs.  Updated the ivl_tests.html file to
reflect work to date.

Note that runsh doesn't use the "verilog" script yet.


8/18/99

New tests added  3.1.5C - 3.1.7B

8/12/99

Initial release to Steve Williams.
