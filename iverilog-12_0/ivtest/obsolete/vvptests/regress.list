# Format of the file
#
# testname	testtype	directory
#
# Note that no  extension is required for the testname, and that the
# sregress.pl logic requires that the FIRST test in the list not be a
# CO class test.
#
# Testtype can be one of
#
# normal:	Normal results expected, i.e it should compile an execute
#               to a PASSED
# CO:		Compile only - Examine the logfile for any errors - shouldn't
#               be any.
# CE:		Compile with Errors - We EXPECT errors - we're checking
#               illegal syntax
#
# The third arguement is the directory, and forth optional is one of
# modulename - Defines the top level module
# gold=filename - Compare a gold file against the generated log file.
# diff=filename1:filename2 - Compare the two files for equality.
